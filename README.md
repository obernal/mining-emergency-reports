# mining-emergency-reports

This repository was created as part of an initiative to mine data from reports created from the site www.terremotoecuador.com which was created by a group of Engineers following the devastating 7.8 Earthquake which hit Ecuador on the night of April 16, 2016.

The team from terremotoecuador.com has provided a database dump with some sample reports which can be used to explore the data. From the DB dump, a data set has been extracted into [ecuador-ayuda.csv](https://github.com/obernal/mining-emergency-reports/blob/master/ecuador_ayuda.csv)

Some of the questions we are trying to answer are:

1. Which items are most needed by the affected areas?
2. Which are the most important items per area (neighborhoods, cities, towns)
3. How do the items rank in order of importance (i.e. what has been donated the most and is less needed vs what is most requested and not attended yet?)
4. How urgent is a report?
5. Which areas need the most help?
6. Which areas are being attended and which haven't been heard yet?
